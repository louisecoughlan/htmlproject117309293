        <p class = "salesforcep">Software as a service(Saas) is a way of 
        <br>delivering centrally hosted applications over
        <br>the Internet, as a service. SaaS applications are
        <br>sometimes called web-based software, 
        <br>on-demand software, or hosted software. 
        <br>Whatever the name, SaaS applications run
        <br>on a SaaS providers servers. Instead of 
        <br>installing and maintaining software, you 
        <br>simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself
        <br>from complex software and hardware 
        <br>management. The provider 
        <br>manages access to the application, including 
        <br>security, availability, 
        <br>and performance.

           Gmail is a free, advertising-supported
           <br>email service developed by Google. 
           <br>Users can access Gmail on the web 
           <br>and using third-party programs that
           <br>synchronize email content through 
           <br>POP or IMAP protocols. Users can 
           <br>access their email anytime, anywhere,
           <br>on any device—no Internet connection 
           <br>needed. Read and draft messages 
           <br>without connectivity, and they’ll 
           <br>be ready to send when you’re back online.
